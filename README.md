## Direct X 7 Scrolling Tiles


</div>

### Description

I searched around here for a LONG time to find out how to scroll Bitmaps. With my code, You can do just that with Direct X... This can be used in creating games like... Civilization, Since it randomly generates a map from a tileset. You can use the Keypad (up,down,left,right) to move the map. Try this out, and if you like it, Vote HIGH.
 
### More Info
 
You should have direct X 7 SDK installed to Compile.
